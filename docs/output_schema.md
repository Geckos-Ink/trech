# Output Schema

TRECH writes JSONL (one JSON object per line). The current schema is small and stable,
so this file documents the exact fields emitted by the runtime.

## trech_provenance.jsonl

Each run emits at least two records (`run_start`, `run_end`). Fields:

- `phase` (string): `"run_start"` or `"run_end"`.
- `config_json` (string): full config JSON string from the JS experiment.
- `config_hash` (string): 64-bit FNV-1a hash of `config_json` in hex.
- `geant4_version` (string): version string from the active Geant4 build.
- `physics_list` (string): physics list name (e.g., `"QBBC"` or `"QBBC+Optical"`).
- `rng_engine` (string): CLHEP RNG engine name.
- `cli_args` (array[string]): argv snapshot used to start the run.
- `macro_path` (string): macro file path if provided, otherwise empty.
- `output_dir` (string): output directory path.
- `n_events` (number): event count used for the run.
- `seed` (number): RNG seed used for the run.

Example:

```json
{"phase":"run_start","config_json":"{\"run\":{\"nEvents\":100}}","config_hash":"f74a5db5b0f602a7","geant4_version":"geant4-11-1","physics_list":"QBBC","rng_engine":"HepJamesRandom","cli_args":["trech","run","exp.js"],"macro_path":"","output_dir":".","n_events":100,"seed":424242}
```

## trech_scores.jsonl

Each run emits a single `run_end` record with run-level scoring summaries.

- `phase` (string): `"run_end"`.
- `total_edep_mev` (number): total energy deposit (MeV).
- `optics_enabled` (boolean): whether optical physics was enabled.
- `optical_photon_tracks` (number): number of optical photon tracks created.
- `optical_photon_steps` (number): number of optical photon steps recorded.
- `optical_photon_track_length_mm` (number): total optical photon track length (mm).
- `n_events` (number): event count used for the run.
- `seed` (number): RNG seed used for the run.
- `physics_list` (string): physics list name used for the run.

Example:

```json
{"phase":"run_end","total_edep_mev":12.34,"optics_enabled":true,"optical_photon_tracks":42,"optical_photon_steps":512,"optical_photon_track_length_mm":987.6,"n_events":100,"seed":424242,"physics_list":"QBBC+Optical"}
```
